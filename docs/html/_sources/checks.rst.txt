Metadata Checks
===============

The user can run a series of checks to verify that certain expected information is contained in the submitted LAS files.

The Checks portion of Q-Checker generates two outputs:

- QA/QC results shapefile
- QA/QC results html dashboard

QA/QC results shapefile
-----------------------

The QA/QC results shapefile contains a polygon for each input LAS tile, along with the associated check results in the shapefile attribute table.  In the image below, the tiles are colored according to whether or not they passed the version test.

QA/QC results html dashboard
----------------------------

The QA/QC results html dashboard contains project-wide summary visualizations of the QA/QC results (see image below).
