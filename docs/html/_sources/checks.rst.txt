Metadata Checks
===============

The user can run a series of checks to verify that certain expected information is contained in the submitted LAS files.

	:widths: 10, 30

    Naming Convention, checks that las files are named according to the *yyyy_[easting]e_[northing]n_las* naming convention
    Version, checks that the las files are the version specified in the corresponding dropdown menu
    Point Data Record Format, checks the Las files contain the propoer PDRF corresponding to the specified version
    GPS Time Type, checks that 'GPS Time Type' in the Las header is 'Satellite Adjusted Time' (not GPS week seconds)
    Horizontal Datum, checks that Las header contains the specified horizontal spatial reference
    Vertical Datum, checks that Las header contains the specified vertical spatial reference
    Point Source IDs, checks that Las file contains > 1 unique point source id (i.e., flight line number)

The Checks portion of Q-Checker generates two outputs:

- QA/QC results shapefile
- QA/QC results html dashboard

QA/QC results shapefile
-----------------------

The QA/QC results shapefile contains a polygon for each input LAS tile, along with the associated check results in the shapefile attribute table.  In the image below, the tiles are colored according to whether or not they passed the version test.

The QA/QC results html dashboard contains project-wide summary visualizations of the QA/QC results (see image below).
